# Resharper Glyphfriend

Resharper Glyphfriend is a Resharper 10+ (10.0.2+?) extension to enhance the IntelliSense to display a preview of glyphs for the common glyph-based font libraries like Font Awesome, Bootstrap, etc.

## Supported Glyph Libraries
* [Bootstrap Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

## TODO
* Add the rest of the commonly used glyph libraries
* Properly set up Resharper ZoneMarker
* Possibly re-write extension to get glyph icons installed into project instead of embedded resources
* Create Logo

## Thanks

Thanks to [Matt Ellis](https://github.com/citizenmatt) pointing me to documentation to extend the Resharper IntelliSense. (Probably more advice in the future)
Thanks to [Rion Williams](https://github.com/Rionmonster) for the great idea and making the Visual Studio extension.

Thanks to my current employer allowing me to make this extension on work time for testing as I do not have a personal copy of Resharper to work with at home.
