# Resharper Glyphfriend

Resharper Glyphfriend is a Resharper 10+ (10.0.2+?) extension to enhance the IntelliSense to display a preview of glyphs for the common glyph-based font libraries like Font Awesome, Bootstrap, etc.

Based on a Visual Studio extension I simply needed: [Glyphfriend](https://github.com/Rionmonster/Glyphfriend)

## Supported Glyph Libraries
* [Bootstrap Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/)
* [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)
* [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)

## TODO
* Add support for [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
* Default Icons
* Properly set up Resharper ZoneMarker
* Re-write extension to load only glyph icons that are installed in solution opened by user
* Create Logo

## Thanks

Thanks to [Matt Ellis](https://github.com/citizenmatt) pointing me to documentation to extend the Resharper IntelliSense. (Probably more advice in the future)

Thanks to [Rion Williams](https://github.com/Rionmonster) for the great idea and making the Visual Studio extension.

Thanks to my current employer allowing me to make this extension on work time for testing as I do not have a personal copy of Resharper to work with at home.
